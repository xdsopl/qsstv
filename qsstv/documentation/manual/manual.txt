\page installation Installation

Warning: from version 9.1.1 and higher,  Jasper library is dropped and openjpeg is used
We need openjpeg2 (e.g. libopenjpeg2.1 or higher) and not libopenjpeg 1.5

\section step1 Step 1: Prerequisites
Before you can compile QSSTV make sure that you have installed the following software
- g++
- libfftw3-dev
- qt5-default (qt4-default)
- hamlib-dev
- libasound2-dev
- libpulse-dev
- libopenjp2-7
- libopenjp2-7-dev
- libv4l-dev


QSSTV is compatible with Qt 4.8.6 but mostly tested on Qt 5.4.x or higher

<p>On Ubuntu, Debian or Mint you can type:

<pre>sudo apt-get install g++ libfftw3-dev qt5-default libpulse-dev</pre>
<pre>sudo apt-get install hamlib-dev libasound-dev  libv4l-dev</pre>
<pre>sudo apt-get install libopenjp2-7 libopenjp2-7-dev</pre>

If you don't find libopenjp2-7 you can download it with the follwing commands if you're running a Debian derived distribution:

<pre>wget http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian/pool/main/o/openjpeg2/libopenjp2-7_2.1.0-2_i386.deb</pre>
<pre>wget http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian/pool/main/o/openjpeg2/libopenjp2-7-dev_2.1.0-2_i386.deb</pre>
or
<pre>wget http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian/pool/main/o/openjpeg2/libopenjp2-7_2.1.0-2_amd64.deb</pre>
<pre>wget http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian/pool/main/o/openjpeg2/libopenjp2-7-dev_2.1.0-2_amd64.deb</pre>

and install the packages with the package manager or simply by double clicking on them.
First install the library and then the development package. This is the case for example for Linux Mint 17.3.


For specific instructions on installation on different distributions: have a look at the FAQ
html http://users.telenet.be/on4qz/qsstv_9/faq.html

\section step2 Step 2: Getting the software

The latest versions of QSSTV is always available at http://users.telenet.be/on4qz
Download the latest tar file to a local directory (e.g. ~/Downloads)

\section step3 Step 3: Compile and Install the software
Go to the directory you have chosen and extract the tar file.
Note: replace the 9.1.1 with the appropriate version you have downloaded
<pre>
>cd ~/Downloads
>tar -xvzf qsstv_9.1.1.tar.gz
>cd qsstv_9.1.1
>qmake
>make
>sudo make install
</pre>
\section step4 Step 4: Run QSSTV
You can now run the program by typing qsstv at the prompt of a terminal session, or make a short cut on your desktop.
<pre>>qsstv</pre>
If you have problems compiling the software, please give as much information as possible but at least:
- Linux Distribution (e.g. Ubuntu 12.10)
- QT Version (e.g Qt 5.4.1)
- Dump of the compile process showing the error

\page gettingstarted Getting Started

The program is build around 3 windows
- Receive window:  Receive functions and configuration
- Transmit window: Transmit functions and camera control
- Gallery window:  History of received images, transmit images and templates
The program will remember the last position and the size of each window on restart.

\section config Configuration

Before we can use QSSTV you need to do some configuration.
\image html config.png
The configuration tool is accessed through the "Options" menu in the receive window.
The following tabs are available
<br><br>
\li Personal Settings
<br><br>
\image html config1.png
<br><br>
- Call sign
- First Name
- Last Name
- QTH
- Locator (Grid Square)
<br>This information can also be used in templates (see also \ref editor)
<br><br>

\li Directories
<br><br>
\image html config2.png
<br><br>
- RX SSTV Images: directory for saving the SSTV received images
- RX DRM Images: directory for saving the DRM received images
- TX Images: directory for images to transmit
- Templates: directory where the template files are stored
- Audio Records: directory for audio files (where you save/read recorded audio files)
- Documentation: URL of the user manual (if you copied the manual locally then you can point to it with e.g. file:///usr/share/doc/qsstv/manual
<br><br>

\li Gui
<br><br>
\image html config3.png
<br><br>
- Stretch: if checked, the image will fill the receive window (keeping the aspect ratio)  else it will be displayed as is.
- Background Colour: colour used for image borders and background in the gallery
- Image Background Colour: Default image background
Push the push button to select the colour selector.
- Gallery: Rows and columns: set-up the number of rows and columns to be used in the Gallery tab. If you're running on a slow CPU (like on a Raspberry Pi) select row=1 and columns=1.
- Slow CPU: Select this option if you're running on a slow CPU (e.g. Rapsberry Pi)
- Low Resolution: Select this option if your display is for example 800x480. This options sets the maximum vertical resolution of QSSTV to less than 480 lines. It therefore removes some features
from the receive window (Rx Notification Window in DRM) and the transmit window (Image replay Preview and TX Notifications in DRM mode).
You can toggle to and from full screen by using the CTRL_F key combination.


<br><br>

\li Audio
<br><br>
\image html config4.png
<br><br>
- ALSA Input Audio Device : depending on your hardware (e.g. default,hw:0,0)
- ALSA Output Audio Device : depending on your hardware (e.g. default,hw:0,0)
- PulseAudio: native pulse audio interface
<br>Note: <b> Most distributions use Pulse Audio interface.. You can select the audio card settings through the audio applet by right clicking on the Speaker icon and selecting the Sound Preferences</b>
- RX Clock frequency : clock used while receiving SSTV images,(see also \ref calib)
- TX Clock frequency : clock used while transmitting SSTV images,(see also \ref calib)
- Sound Input routing
   - From sound card: default mode
   - From file: decode a previously recorded file
   - From sound card and record: decode and record to a file (wav type, stereo 48000)
   - Maximum recording size: limits the size of the recorded file
- Sound Output routing
   - To sound card: default
   - Playback: playback a wav-file (use 48000 samples per second recording in mono or stereo)
   - Playback and record: playback the sound and record at the same time.
 - Swap left and right channel
    - If selected, audio will be sent on the right audio channel instead of the left channel (e.g Kenwood tranceivers using USB sound interfaces)
 - PTT tone on other audio channel
    - A tone will be sent on the right channel to enable PTT. If the above "Swap left and right channel" is selected, it will be sent on the left channel.
<br><br>
Note: To playback an audio file, be sure the format is of type wav and has a samplerate of 48000 samples/second. You can always open the file with audacity and export the file to adapt the type and/or
 samplerate<br>


\li CAT
<br><br>
\image html config5.png
<br><br>

- Special Serial Port: If you have a separate serial interface to control the PTT you can enable Special Serial Port to control it.
You can select RTS and or DTR in inverted or non-inverted mode (i.e. +RTS will assert RTS at +12V when the PTT is active
and -RTS will assert RTS at -12V). +RTS and/or +DTR is used most of the time.
The same goes for DTR.
<br>
You cannot select both +RTS and -RTS or +DTR and -DTR at the same time.
- Enable Hamlib Cat Interface
 - Radio Model: drop down list from the radio models
 - CIV Address: only used for ICOM, if left empty, the default address of the radio will be used
 - Serial Port/host: either the serial port (e.g. /dev/ttyUSB0) or the host address (e.g. localhost:4532)
 - Handshake, Parity, Data bits, Stop bits, Baud rate: serial port settings
 - PTT Serial Port: serial port (e.g. /dev/ttyS0) only used if  "Enable PTT serial Interface" is selected
 - PTT Control via: If the radio uses a CAT command to activate Transmission then select "CAT". If you have a radio that does not support such a CAT command, you can
let Hamlib use the RTS or DTR on the serial port specified by "PTT Serial Port".
- There are 2 CAT ports:
    -CAT (voice port): the normal setting
    -CAT (data port): to be used with some kenwood tranceivers(e.g. kenwood TS-480) to force data port instead of audio port (source: David  VK3DCU)
Example: IC-706MKIIG via a cat interface such as interfaceOne.
\anchor flrigconfig
- Enable XMLRPC
 This allows you to connect to the Flrig program using the XMLRPC protocol. Flrig will handle all the communication with the transceiver (including PTT).
- TX Delay: The program will wait for the selected delay before transmitting any audio.


Note: The option Enable XMLRPC excludes the use of hamlib.

A sample set-up of Flrig is shown below.
<br><br>
\image html flrig1.png
<br><br>




\li CW
<br><br>
\image html config6.png
<br><br>
- Tone: frequency of the CW tone
- Words per Minute: CW transmission speed
- Text To Send: this text will be send at the end of an image transmission if the option is enabled.




\li Repeater
<br><br>
\image html config7.png
<br><br>
- Enable repeater: enable repeater operation
- Image Interval (min): interval time before sending one of the Idle Images
- Repeater TX mode: the mode the repeater will use to send the images
- Idle Image[1-4]: images send by the repeater if there is no activity for more than the interval time
- Idle Template:template that will be super-imposed on the idle images
- Repeater Template: template that will be super-imposed on the repeated(received) images

\li FTP
<br><br>
\image html config8.png
<br><br>
This is used to save the received images to an FTP server. The images will also still be saved in the local rx folder.
- Enable FTP: enable ftp operation
- FTP Port: default 21
- Default Image Format: select the image format from the drop down bow (used only in SSTV)
- Remote Hostname: hostname of the ftp server (e.g. myftp.home.net or 192.168.0.1)
- Remote directory:the ftp server directory where you'll store the images
- FTP Login name: your login name on the server (can be anonymous)
- FTP Password: if you need one, otherwise leave blank
- Image store:
  - Image1 - image30: The files will be saved under the generic name imageXX, where xx ranges from 1 to 30. When a new image arrives, the old images are shifted down
  (i.e. image29 becomes image30, image28 becomes image 29 etc ..) and the new one is stored as image1.
  -file name: the image (or other type of file) is stored with a file name derived from the mode (SSTV) or from the file name transmitted in DRM.

Note: This FTP server is unrelated to the FTP server for Hybrid Mode.

You can test the connection by clicking the Test connection button. It will set-up a connection to the server and send a test file to check if all parameters are correct.
You will either see a pop-up with "Connection OK" or an error message showing the reason of the fail.




\li Waterfall
<br><br>
\image html config9.png
<br><br>
- Start Pic: Waterfall text to send at the beginning of a DRM transmission
- End Pic: Waterfall text to send at the end of a DRM transmission
- FIX: Waterfall text to send at the beginning of a DRM retransmission
- BSR: Waterfall text to send at the beginning of a DRM request for retransmission
<br> Note: you can also use %%m. This will be replaced by your call sign


\li Hybrid
<br><br>
\image html config10.png
<br><br>
- Enable Reception in Hybrid Mode: allows reception of hamDRM in hybrid mode. If this is not enabled, hybrid mode files will not be shown or stored.
- FTP Port: default 21 (cannot be modified at this moment for compatibility with EasyPal)
- Remote Hostname: hostname of your ftp server
- Remote directory:the ftp server directory where the stored images are
- FTP Login name: the login name on the server
- FTP Password: will be encrypted

Login name, password,hostname and directories will be encrypted before being sent on the air.

If you want to use the special server, the directories to store images is relative to the directory HybridFiles1. So first create a top level directory HybridFiles1.
If you leave the Remote Directory empty, then the files will be placed in the directory HybridFiles1.
If you put for example "testdir" in the Remote Directory (as shown in the above screen shot), then you need to create testdir under HybridFiles (HybridFiles1/testdir).

QSSTV will not create those directories for you.

EasyPal also use two other directories on the same level as HybridFiles1
- OnlineCallsigns1
- RxOkNotifications1

You can create them on your server but they are not used by QSSTV at this moment.

You can test the connection by clicking the Test connection button. It will setup a connection to the server and send a test file to check if all parameters are correct.
You will either see a pop-up with "Connection OK" or an error message showing the reason of the fail.

\li DRM Profiles
<br><br>
\image html config11.png
<br><br>
Used for quick selection of the most common settings you use in DRM.
Choose a short name for the profile and make a selection for all the parameters.
The name will appear in the Profiles drop-down box in the Transmit window for DRM.

\li Frequencies
\anchor configFreq
<br><br>
\image html config12.png
<br><br>
- List of selectable frequencies. Click Add to add a new combo frequency/mode/modulation. Enter the frequency and select the mode and modulation type.<br>
To move a frequency/mode/modulation  up or down the list, click first on the entry in the table and then click on one of the arrow buttons.

- Hamlib Data Command: (only used with Hamlib) As far a I know Hamlib does not support switching the Icomxxx to data mode.
As a result, if you for example selected USB-D1 on a Icom 7600,changing the frequency will switch the rig back to the regular USB (data mode off).<br>
Hamlib Data Command allows you to send a "raw command" that will be executed when you change frequencies.

- Example: FEFE7AE01A060101FD and Hex button checked: will put the Icom in data mode D1 (LSB, USB or FM) and the Filter 1.

- Hex: if checked the text is interpreted as hex values else it will be interpreted as a regular ASCII string.

- Note 1: you can put any valid raw command here, it will be send on every frequency change

- Note 2: Flrig does not support FM data modes.



\section calib Calibration
Note: Calibration is only needed for SSTV mode
All SSTV applications need an accurate and stable clock. The accuracy of a PC clock is not always correct.
Therefore it's necessary to execute some sort of calibration.
You need to synchronize your PC with an network time server via the ntp protocol.
Every Linux distribution has some configuration tool that allows you to install the ntp client. Be sure it's active.
You can check it with:
<pre>
>ntpdc -p
</pre>

The selected ntp server should have an asterisk in the first column.
<pre>
remote           local      st poll reach  delay   offset    disp
=======================================================================
*stratum1dc1.bc  10.119.37.19     2   64  377 0.00386  0.036853 0.06850
</pre>

You can now launch the Calibration.<br><br>
<b>It will take several minutes to complete. Be sure to wait long enough, the progress is extremely slow</b>
<br><br>
\image html calibration.png
When RX and TX calibration is finished, press the OK button to accept the new values.

\li Note: You can always enter the clock values manually.


\page statusbar Statusbar
\image html statusbar.png
- Radio Frequency: the current frequency of the radio (only if CAT interface is enabled)
- Drop down menu to set the radio on the selected frequency (only if CAT interface is enabled) (see also \ref configFreq Config freq)
- WF Text: gives you a selection of user defined text you can send to appear as waterfall text.
<br><br>
\image html wftextpopup.png
<br>
Send the text by clicking the tx button next to it<br>
The %%m will be substituted by your callsign and the %%s by the average SNR of the last received DRM stream.
<br><br>

- BSR: When a file is not completely received, you can ask for a retransmission.
 \image html bsr_select.png
 By default the latest received file is selected (you can select another one through the drop-down box).
<br>There are two modes: EasyPal and Compatible. EasyPal mode is more advanced and is normally used as EasyPal is the de facto standard on Windows and QSSTV also uses this mode in BSR reception.
<br>Note: BSR is greyed out in SSTV.
<br><br>
- WF ID: send callsign in waterfall - this is a short-cut to send your own callsign in the waterfall
- CW ID: send callsign in CW
<br><br>
- PTT indicator: turns red while the PTT is activated.

\page imagepopup Image Viewer
All the images displayed in QSSTV have pop-up actions. This is an example for the Gallery.

<br>
\image html Gallery_image_options.png
<br><br>
By right clicking on the images, a pop-up window appears that can have one or more of the following actions:
- New: open the editor to create a new image.
- Load: load new file into window
- To TX: send image to TX window
- Edit: edit the selected image
- Print: print the selected image
- Delete: delete the selected image, a pop-up will ask if you want to delete the file also from disk., if so the file will be moved to the trash folder.
- View: Display the image in a new window actual size (the window is resizeable).
- Properties: displays the image and file properties if available




\page RXSSTV Receive SSTV Window
\image html rxwidget1.png
Menu toolbar:
\li \image html start.png
start receiving images
\li \image html stop.png
stop receiving images
\li \image html replay.png
force a restart (e.g. when you see a wrong synchronization then click the restart button).
\li \image html filesave.png
save the image at any time using the save button. You will probably want to use this if the Auto-save is not selected. Note only active in SSTV mode.
\li \image html eraser.png
erase the screen



Sync Indicator (vu-meter S):
- sync quality ranging from 0-10

Volume (vu-meter V):
- adjust your recording level to half scale.

SSTV tab:
- Use VIS Code: the reception will only start if a correct VIS code is received. If left unchecked, QSSTV will auto-detect the modes (this is the most used method).
- Auto-slant: A lot of times the receive clock of the local station is not equal to the transmit clock of the sending station. The result is a slanted image.
If The auto-slant is activated, the program will automatically try to compensate for those clock differences.
You may notice a momentary freeze of the image build-up while the program is recalculating the image.
- Auto-save: When the program detect the end of the image, the image will be saved to disk.
- Save if Complete %: Auto-save if the image is at least completed for the indicated percentage.
- Mode: you can either select AUTO or one of the supported SSTV modes.
When AUTO is selected, the program will try to determine the mode of the image it is receiving.
If a specific mode is selected the program will reject all images except if they are transmitted in the selected mode.
- Signals: Normal and DX.
When the Sensitivity is set to DX the signal will run until the end of the image before resynchronization.


Spectrum and Waterfall:<br>
There are three markers for SSTV (red lines):
- 1200: Sync frequency
- 1500: Lower video frequency
- 2300: Upper video frequency
In DRM, the markers indicate the 3 unmodulated carrier frequencies

\anchor Control
- Select CW if you want to append a morse message after the image (the message is set in Options->Configuration->CW) .
- If the VOX check-box is set a tone will be sent before the actual image is sent so that you can use the VOX
on your transceiver (if you do not have PTT control).
- Select the template (or none) you want as an overlay (see \ref gallery). Only the templates
that are in the Gallery will be available.

The text inputs correspond to the following macros:

\li TO: %%c - call of the contacted station
\li RSV %%r - RSV (radio-strength-video best is 595)
\li Op: %%o - name of the operator of the contacted station
\li x %%x - comment1
\li y %%y - comment2
\li z %%z - comment3
\n see also \ref editor

- The last received image is displayed at the bottom right. It will be updated automatically as
new images are received. They can be inserted if you use a template containing an "image replay object" see also \ref editor
<br>
Right clicking on this image also allows you to load other images for insertion. Use the refresh button to update the main window if necessary.


\page RXDRM Receive DRM Window
\image html receivedrm.png

SNR (vu-meter S):
- SNR in dB

Volume (vu-meter V):
- adjust your recording level to half scale (better too low than too high).

Received segments:
\image html rxdrm_segments.png
- green: correctly received segments
- red: missing segments

Constellation:
\image html rxdrm_constellation.png

- FAC constellation (always QAM 4)
- MSC constellation.


Receive status
\image html rxdrm_status.png
- Mode (A,B or E)
- Bandwidth (2.2 kHz or 2.5 kHz)
- Interleave (Short or Long)
- Protection (Normal or High)
- QAM (4,16 or 64)
- SNR (should be above 6 dBm)
- Offset (0 Hz if no frequency offset)
- Total Segm.: total number of segments in the file
- RX Sgmnts.: number of correctly received segment
- Cur. Sgmnt.: segment currently transmitted
- Transp. ID; unique identifier for the current stream.
- Callsign from the transmitting station


\image html statusleds.png
- TIME: green if time sync else red
- FRAME: green if frame sync else red
- FAC: green if FAC correctly received else red
- MSC:
	- red: incorrectly received
	- green: correctly received
	- yellow: already received

When an data stream is received , the program will try to decode it and save it in the receive image directory.
If the data stream is a text file it will be displayed in a separate window. Just click OK to close it.

\image html waterfall.png
Spectrum:<br>
You can select the spectrum or the waterfall by clicking in this window. In DRM the waterfall gives you better view.
The three markers above the waterfall indicate  the position of the pilot frequencies. This helps tuning the radio to the correct frequency.

<br>Avoid to send huge images (especially if you're not in hybrid mode).<br>
You can drag the slider to compress the image before it is sent (the original image is not modified). The file size is shown on the right. You can see the result in the image frame when you release the handle.
<br>
Note: This does not include the overhead of the RS-encoding.


\page fixdrm Sending FIX in DRM
\image html fix.png

When the image you transmitted is not correctly received, the other station can send a BSR. When you receive a BSR and it is destined for you, then the above popup will show.
You can either send the fix or cancel.<br>
If the BSR is not for you then the following window will pop-up for a few seconds.
\image html bsr_nfy.png



\page gallery Gallery
The Gallery contains six tabs. The directories where the different images are stored are configured in the Directories tab of the Configuration.
<br>
\image html Gallery_rx.png
<br>
- RX SSTV: SSTV images are stored on disk and shown here if the Auto-save is enabled in the receive window and the minimum percentage is reached
- RX DRM:  All images received in DRM mode are stored on disk and shown here.
- TX SSTV: When sending an image in SSTV mode then the resulting images is stored on disk and shown here (this includes the template overlay).
- TX DRM:  When sending an image in SSTV mode then the resulting images is stored on disk and shown here (this includes the template overlay).
- TX Stock: Contains your selection of "Stock" images you want to use for transmission.
- Templates: template images to be used as overlay on tx images

\page editor Editor
The editor can be used for regular image editing and for the creation and editing of template images.
Template images are used as overlays. They will be dynamically adapted when you select the template in the TX-window.
While in edit mode, you can change all the attributes (such as size, position, colours etc ...). If you save the canvas as an
image, the scene will be rendered (i.e. flattened) and become a single image object. If you save the canvas as a template, all objects
will be accessible again when loaded.

<br>
To create an object, click on the left menu to select the type of object (e.g circle) and then click on the canvas where you want the object positioned.
Just click on an item to select it. A outline of the item will be shown by a dashed line.
If you hoover over the object you will see the cursor change to a hand-icon (in the middle of the object) to move it, or to a resize-icon if you are on a border.

The attributes (line colour, fill colour, gradients etc ..) that are active in the top menu will be used to create the item.
Object have also a z-component, i.e they can be in front our behind another object. This can be changed by right clicking on the item and use the Arrange selection.


\image html editor_1.png
\li Top menu 1
- Image Size: Select the size of the image: the outline of the image will be shown on the canvas.
\image html editor_image_size.png
- Font: drop down box where you can select the text font
- Font size: text size
- Bold : bold text
- Italic: italic text
- Underline: underlined text
- Pen width: width of lines in number of pixels
\li Top menu 2
- Fill: Fill colour drop down menu
- Line: Line colour drop down menu
- Gradient: Gradient selection menu

\li  Left menu

-\image html text.png
create text. When you select this option a window will pop-up to enter text.
<br>
-\image html entertext.png
<br>You can enter multiple lines of text. Click OK, the window will be hidden and you can click on the canvas to position the text.
The text will appear on the canvas.
-\image html multiline.png
<br>

\li Bottom menu
- Horizontal Shear: shear selected object horizontally
- Rotate: rotate selected object
\li Right menu
- Vertical Shear: shear selected object vertically
<p>
If you right click on an object then the following pop-up menu will be shown:</p>
\li Arrange
- Forward - one level forward
- Backward - one level backward
- Bring to Front - all the way to the front
- Sent to Back - all the way to the back
\li Change text - change the text of a text object
\li Expand - object will expand horizontally and vertically to fill the complete canvas
\li Delete - remove selected object from the canvas
\li Lock - lock items so that they can not be moved or resized
\li Unlock - unlock selected items

<p> We need some sort of macro's to enable variable text when transmitting images. The editor uses predefined strings that will be replaced by
the "actual content" when the template is processed just before transmission.<br>

Here's an example of the editor using macros and the result in the transmitter.</p>
<br>
\image html editor_2.png
<br><br>
\image html transmitdrm.png


Following macro's are supported:<br>
Macro's where the value is defined in the configuration
\li %%m - my callsign
\li %%q - my QTH
\li %%l - my locator
\li %%n - my last name
\li %%f - my first name

Macro's where the value is entered in the TX-window prior to transmission
\li %%c - call of the contacted station
\li %%r - RSV (radio-strength-video best is 595) You can also input free text as is sometimes required for contest (e.g. 595#007 or Good Copy)
\li %%o - name of the operator of the contacted station
\li %%x - comment1
\li %%y - comment2
\li %%z - comment3

Note: comment 1,2 and 3 can be multi-line.

Macro's where the value is defined by the system
\li %%t - time in hours:minutes format
\li %%d - date in year/month/day format
\li %%v - qsstv_version
\li %%s - SNR - only to be used for DRM in the WF Text see also \ref statusbar



\page credits Credits
- SSTV:<br>
Many thanks to all testers and users of QSSTV - too many to name them all.
<br><br>
- DRM:<br>
I started developing the DRM functionality in QSSTV after studying the excellent work Ties Bos (PA0MBO) did on txrxamadrm.<br>
see: http://www.pa0mbo.nl/ties/public_html/hamradio/txamadrm/index.html<br>
The software is NOT based on the hamdrm.dll but on DIORAMA (http://nt.eit.uni-kl.de/static/diorama/index.html)<br>and adapted by PA0MBO. For more information , see the manual of txrxamadrm.

This document contains references to Easypal (by VK4AES). Erik Sundstrup was kind enough to give me permission to use the extended BSR functionality and the DRM Hybrid mode.
Easypal was used extensively to test my program. <br>
<br>
\image html vk4aes.jpg
<br><br>

Erik is now silent key as of 14th march 2015.     We will miss him.
<br>
I hope there will be other OM's that take up the maintenance,enhancements  and development of EasyPal so that people running Windows will continue to enjoy his software.

\page externalprog External Programs

QSSTV can interface with other programs.
<br><br> Flrig see \ref flrigconfig

<br><br>
Cqrlog: QSSTV (when in DRM mode) sends the following information to Cqrlog:
- program: identifies QSSTV
- version: protocol version
- date: based on UTC
- time: based on UTC (time when the images is correctly received)
- endtime: based on UTC (always = time)
- call: call sign of the received station
- mhz: frequency in MHz
- mode: SSTV (ADIF restriction: there is no DSSTV nor DRM specified in ADIF, SSTV is the closest match)
- notes: contains file name, DRM mode information (i.e mode, QAM, protection.. hybrid)

<br><br>
- Setup: <br><br>\image html cqrlog1.png <br>
<br><br>
- Do not enable Run Fldigi ...
- Start Cqrlog and select Remote mode for Fldigi
- If you want to see the QSO's: Select "Show QSO list" from the file menu.<br><br>
\image html cqrlog2.png
<br>
Note: Unless you configured the Automatic refresh, you will only see the QSO's if you hit the Refresh button.
